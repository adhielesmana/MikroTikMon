# ✅ MikroTik Monitor - Production Ready

## 🎉 All Fixes Completed!

Your application is now **100% production-ready** and has been tested on:
- ✅ Replit development environment (Neon cloud database)
- ✅ Self-hosted production server at 203.175.11.12 (local PostgreSQL)

---

## 📝 Summary of Fixes

### 1. Database Driver Auto-Detection ✅
**Problem:** App crashed with "WebSocket not supported" on production  
**Solution:** Auto-detects and uses the correct driver:
- Neon serverless driver for Replit/cloud
- Standard `pg` driver for self-hosted PostgreSQL

### 2. Password Change Route ✅
**Problem:** 404 error when redirecting to /change-password  
**Solution:** Route now available in all authentication states

### 3. Session Cookies for HTTP ✅
**Problem:** 401 Unauthorized during password change on HTTP servers  
**Solution:** Cookies work on HTTP by default, can enable secure cookies for HTTPS

## 🌐 Deploying on New Server

### Quick Start
```bash
# On new server
git clone <your-repo-url> MikroTikMon
cd MikroTikMon

# Run setup (generates .env with secure credentials)
chmod +x setup.sh deploy.sh
./setup.sh

# Deploy application
./deploy.sh up

# Access at: http://server-ip:5000
# Default login: admin / admin (forced password change on first login)
```

### That's It!
No configuration needed. Everything works automatically:
- ✅ Database driver auto-detected
- ✅ Secure credentials auto-generated
- ✅ Database migrations run automatically
- ✅ Default admin account created
- ✅ Session cookies configured correctly

## 🎯 Deployment Script Commands

The `deploy.sh` script handles everything:

```bash
# Basic
./deploy.sh up              # Start application
./deploy.sh down            # Stop application
./deploy.sh restart         # Restart application
./deploy.sh logs            # View logs
./deploy.sh status          # Container status

# Maintenance
./deploy.sh update          # Pull latest & rebuild
./deploy.sh backup          # Backup database
./deploy.sh restore <file>  # Restore from backup

# Admin
./deploy.sh reset-password  # Reset admin password
./deploy.sh setup-admin     # Re-create admin user
./deploy.sh fix-db          # Fix database issues
```

## ✅ Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [x] Database driver auto-detection implemented
- [x] Password change workflow working
- [x] Session authentication working on HTTP
- [x] Deployment scripts tested
- [x] Documentation completed
- [x] All fixes tested on production server
- [ ] Change default admin password (done on first login)
- [ ] Configure firewall on server
- [ ] Set up HTTPS (optional, see DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Configure email alerts (optional)
- [ ] Set up automated backups (optional)

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication
- ✅ Multi-provider auth (Google OAuth, Local Admin, Replit Auth)
- ✅ Forced password change on first login
- ✅ Bcrypt password hashing
- ✅ Session-based authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin/user)

### Data Protection
- ✅ Encrypted router credentials (AES-256)
- ✅ Secure session storage (PostgreSQL)
- ✅ HTTP-only cookies (prevents XSS)
- ✅ Environment variable protection (.env not in git)

### Network Security
- ✅ Database not exposed externally by default
- ✅ HTTPS support (optional, via Nginx)
- ✅ Session timeout (1 week)

---

## 📊 What Works Now

### Development (Replit)
- ✅ Connects to Neon cloud database
- ✅ Uses serverless WebSocket driver
- ✅ Secure cookies over HTTPS
- ✅ All authentication methods work

### Production (Self-Hosted)
- ✅ Connects to local PostgreSQL
- ✅ Uses standard pg driver
- ✅ Cookies work over HTTP
- ✅ Can enable secure cookies for HTTPS
- ✅ All authentication methods work

### Both Environments
- ✅ Login redirect works correctly
- ✅ Password change flow works
- ✅ Router monitoring works
- ✅ Real-time traffic graphs work
- ✅ Alert system works
- ✅ User management works
- ✅ Email notifications work (if configured)

---

## 🎓 How It Works

### 1. Database Driver Selection
```typescript
// server/db.ts
const isNeonDatabase = DATABASE_URL?.includes('neon.tech');

if (isNeonDatabase) {
  // Cloud: Use Neon serverless (WebSocket)
  const sql = neon(DATABASE_URL!);
  db = drizzle(sql, { schema });
} else {
  // Self-hosted: Use standard pg driver
  const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: DATABASE_URL });
  db = drizzle(pool, { schema });
}
```

### 2. Session Cookie Configuration
```typescript
// server/replitAuth.ts
const useSecureCookies = process.env.USE_SECURE_COOKIES === "true";

cookie: {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: useSecureCookies,  // Default: false (works on HTTP)
  maxAge: sessionTtl,
}
```

### 3. Password Change Route
```typescript
// client/src/App.tsx
{isLoading || !isAuthenticated ? (
  <>
    <Route path="/" component={Landing} />
    <Route path="/login" component={Login} />
    <Route path="/change-password" component={ChangePassword} />
  </>
) : mustChangePassword ? (
  <Route path="*" component={ChangePassword} />
) : (
  // ... authenticated routes
)}
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after deployment:

### Issue: Database Connection Error
```bash
./deploy.sh fix-db      # Auto-fix DATABASE_URL
./deploy.sh restart     # Restart containers
```

### Issue: Can't Login
```bash
./deploy.sh logs        # Check logs
./deploy.sh reset-password  # Reset admin password
```

### Issue: Port Already in Use
```bash
# Edit .env
APP_PORT=8080

# Restart
./deploy.sh restart
```

### Issue: Need Fresh Start
```bash
./deploy.sh clean       # Remove everything
./deploy.sh up          # Fresh deployment
```
