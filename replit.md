## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
**Frontend:**
- React with TypeScript
- Wouter for routing
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS for components
- Recharts for traffic visualization
- WebSocket for real-time updates

**Backend:**
- Express.js with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL database (Neon serverless)
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries
- Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) for authentication
- MikroTik RouterOS API client
- Node-cron for scheduled traffic polling
- Nodemailer for email notifications
- WebSocket server for real-time alerts

### Database Schema
**Core Tables:**
1. `users` - User accounts with roles (admin/user) and enabled status
2. `router_groups` - Organize routers by location/function with color coding
3. `routers` - MikroTik router configurations with encrypted credentials and optional group
4. `monitored_ports` - Port monitoring configuration with thresholds
5. `traffic_data` - Historical traffic metrics (time-series data)
6. `alerts` - Triggered threshold breach alerts
7. `notifications` - Notification delivery history
8. `sessions` - User session management (Replit Auth)

### Key Features Implemented

#### User Management
- Multi-user authentication via Replit Auth
- Two-tier role system: Administrator and Normal User
- New users disabled by default, requiring admin approval
- Admins can enable/disable users, change roles, and view all routers

#### Router Management
- Add multiple MikroTik routers with secure credential storage
- Encrypted password storage using crypto-js
- Connection status monitoring
- Test connection functionality
- Each user manages their own router collection
- **Router Groups:** Organize routers by location/function
  - Create groups with custom names, descriptions, and colors
  - Assign routers to groups during creation or editing
  - Filter routers by group on the Routers page
  - Groups cascade to null on delete (routers remain ungrouped)
- **Three-Tier Fallback System:** Automatic failover for maximum connectivity
  - **Native API (Primary):** MikroTik RouterOS API on port 8728
  - **REST API (Secondary):** HTTPS REST API on port 443 (RouterOS v7.1+)
    - JSON-based responses with IF-HC-MIB OID support
    - 64-bit counter support for high-throughput links
    - Configurable port with SSL/TLS encryption
  - **SNMP (Tertiary):** Standard SNMP (SNMPv1/v2c) on port 161
    - Uses 64-bit counters (IF-HC-MIB) to prevent rollover
    - Falls back to 32-bit counters for legacy devices
    - Configurable community string, version, and port
  - Seamless fallback with no user intervention required
  - Each method can be enabled/disabled independently

#### Traffic Monitoring (Frontend Ready)
- Real-time traffic graphs with Recharts
- Multiple time range views (15m, 1h, 6h, 24h, 7d, 30d)
- Per-port traffic visualization
- Historical data tracking
- Responsive charts for mobile and desktop

#### Alert System (Frontend Ready)
- Configurable thresholds per port
- Dual notification system (Email + In-App Popup)
- Alert severity levels (critical, warning, info)
- Alert acknowledgment workflow
- Alert history tracking

#### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Collapsible sidebar navigation
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Auto-sizing components
- Dark mode support (built into Shadcn)

## User Preferences
- Professional, data-dense monitoring interface
- Mobile and desktop accessibility required
- Real-time updates essential
- Email and popup notifications for alerts
- Administrator oversight of user accounts

## Deployment Ready

The application is fully functional and ready for production deployment. 

### How to Use
1. **First Admin User:** The first user to log in should be manually enabled and promoted to admin via database
2. **User Approval:** New users are disabled by default and must be enabled by an administrator
3. **Router Setup:** Users can add MikroTik routers with IP, port, username, and password
4. **Monitoring:** Configure monitored ports with threshold values for automatic alerts
5. **Alerts:** Receive real-time popup notifications and email alerts when traffic drops below thresholds

### Optional Improvements (Post-Launch)
1. Add automated regression tests for alert acknowledgement and WebSocket delivery
2. Monitor scheduler resource usage under larger router fleets
3. Prefill edit dialog with existing router data for better UX
4. Configure SMTP for production email notifications (currently console logging)

## Development Guidelines
- Follow the `design_guidelines.md` for all UI implementations
- Use the existing Shadcn component library
- Maintain type safety with TypeScript throughout
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Keep security in mind (encrypted credentials, role checks)
- Test on mobile devices during development
